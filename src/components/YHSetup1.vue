      <h2>Step 1: Gather Required Equipment</h2>
      <p>Gather the following items and then click <b>Next</b>.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>A laptop that can run Ubuntu and Bitcoin Core. Almost any laptop made for Windows will work, but if your laptop has an SSD type hard drive some steps will take a few hours instead of a few days. Laptops without SSD type drives cost about $150 USD and laptops with SSD drives cost about $200 USD. You can also buy a new laptop from a store like Amazon or Walmart and return it when you are finished with setup because your bitcoin will be stored on paper and CD-ROM disks.</li>
            <li>An optical drive to write to the CDs. Most laptops come with one built in, but you can also    buy an external optical drive for about $15 on Amazon.</li>
            <li>5 blank CD-R disks. Label each the blank disks "Level One Seed".</li>
            <li>2 USB thumb drives. These will cost about $3 each and will be used to install Ubuntu and to erase your laptop. Label one "Ubuntu" and the other "Transfer."</li>
            <li>5 full page size envelopes.</li>
        </ul>
